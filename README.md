# Ad Campaign Optimization Dashboards

## Introduction
I developed two interactive dashboards to analyze the performance of 50,000 ad campaigns. The goal was to identify key trends and provide actionable recommendations to optimize budget allocation and improve signup rates.

## Data
The dataset contains 50,000 ad campaign records with the following key metrics:
- Platform (e.g., LinkedIn, Google Ads, Instagram, Facebook)
- Location (e.g., USA, Europe, Asia, Rest of the World)
- Ad Type (Image, Text, Video)
- Target Audience (Professionals, Seniors, Young Adults)
- Budget Range (High, Medium, Low)
- Campaign Duration (Long, Medium, Short)
- Total Signups, CTR (Click-Through Rate), Signup Rate, Cost per Signup

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Loaded the dataset into Tableau Public.
   - Cleaned and formatted the data for analysis.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Created two dashboards:
     - **Overview Dashboard**: High-level insights on signups by platform and location.
     - **Detailed Analysis Dashboard**: Detailed analysis of CTR, signup rates, and cost per signup by budget and duration.
   - Used pie charts, bar charts, and tables to visualize the data.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Calculated average CTR, signup rate, and cost per signup.
   - Identified top-performing platforms, locations, ad types, and campaign strategies.

## Results
- **Platform Performance**: LinkedIn generated the highest number of signups (2.83M), followed by Google Ads (4.35M).
- **Location Performance**: USA and Europe led with 3.63M and 3.14M signups, respectively.
- **CTR and Signup Rate**: Image ads targeting Professionals had the highest CTR (2.0330%) and signup rate (2.7638%).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Medium-budget campaigns (1000-3000) with long durations (>60 days) had the lowest cost per signup ($6.381).

## Conclusions and Recommendations
- **Focus on LinkedIn and Google Ads**: These platforms drive the most signups.
- **Target Professionals with Image Ads**: This combination yields the highest CTR and signup rates.
- **Use Medium-budget campaigns (1000-3000) with Long durations (>60 days)**: This strategy is the most cost-efficient.
- **Prioritize USA and Europe**: These regions generate the highest signups.

## Technical Details
- **Tools Used**: Tableau Public for data visualization, Excel for initial data exploration.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Data cleaning, data visualization, dashboard design, insight generation.

## Limitations and Next Steps
- **Limitations**:
  - Tableau Public has limitations in terms of data privacy and advanced features.
  - The dataset lacks additional metrics like conversion rates or user demographics.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Incorporate more granular data (e.g., user demographics, ad content).
  - Explore advanced analytics (e.g., predictive modeling) to forecast campaign performance.
